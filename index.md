### Voice based Tone and Person Identification on STM32L4

In this project, we created a smart voice based human identification system that is capable of recognizing periodic sounds like aa, ee & oo and the human who is pronouncing them. The audio input is sampled through a microphone and analyzed in real time using STM32L4 series microcontroller. Our system is trained to recognize  the voice of the speaker on which the model is trained in our case we three. In addition, it is also capable of identifying the sounds of aa,ee,oo pronounced by any human being  in real time. Some of the topics we explored extensively in this project are Fast Fourier Transform, human speech analysis, MFCC and Machine Learning techniques for classification.
