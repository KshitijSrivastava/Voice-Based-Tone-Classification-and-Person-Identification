# Voice based Tone and Person Identification on STM32L4

This project was made as part of EED308- Embedded System Hardware, Spring 2018 at Shiv Nadar University under the supervised guidance of Professor R.N Biswas.

In this project, we created a smart voice based human identification system that is capable of recognizing periodic sounds like aa, ee & oo and the human who is pronouncing them. The audio input is sampled through a microphone and analyzed in real time using STM32L4 series microcontroller. Our system is trained to recognize  the voice of the speaker on which the model is trained in our case we three. In addition, it is also capable of identifying the sounds of aa,ee,oo pronounced by any human being  in real time. Some of the topics we explored extensively in this project are Fast Fourier Transform, human speech analysis, MFCC and Machine Learning techniques for classification.

## Key Points for this Project 

### Usage of IDE's

Free versions of IDE's like Keil, IAR wont work with CMSIS DSP Library, since they have limited memory in the free version. Instead free IDE's like Atollic True Studio, GNU Eclipse based free IDE's should be used which dont have the memory constraint.

### Installation of CMSIS DSP Library

Download the CMSIS Library from the following [link](https://github.com/ARM-software/CMSIS_5) and follow the instruction as given in the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLHkYlF3suc&feature=youtu.be).

## Materials needed
Analog Mic/ Sound Detector Module
Resistance and Capacitances to make a low pass filter
LED


## Initialization in Cube Mx

### For ADC-DMA
We need sampling frequency of the ADC to be around 8k Hz since the voice signal can hardly exceed this voice.
We initialized ADC DMA in Continuous Mode with High Speed Clock Frequency as 16 Mhz. The Prescaler value of 8 was chosen so that ADC Clock Frequency=2Mhz. No of cycles is chosen to be 247.5, so that the sampling freq= 7600 Hz.

Total of 256 data points is being stored in the array which is circular in nature.


### For Interrupt Generation

PC13 could also be used as an interrupt to start the ADC-DMA whenever the voice signal exceed a threshold value that is set on the analog microphone(The Digital Output of Mic connected to the PC13). Whenever the voice exceed the threshold, the program would go as the Interrupt Service Routine.


### For LED Pins
3 LED pins were chosen for the purpose of showing which person is speaking, 3 LED was used for showing what alphabet is he being spoken, 1 LED for showing misclassified answer and 1 LED to know when DMA is storing the data.
