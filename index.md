# Voice based Tone and Person Identification on STM32L4

This project was made as part of EED308- Embedded System Hardware, Spring 2018 at Shiv Nadar University under the supervised guidance of Professor R.N Biswas.

In this project, we created a smart voice based human identification system that is capable of recognizing periodic sounds like aa, ee & oo and the human who is pronouncing them. The audio input is sampled through a microphone and analyzed in real time using STM32L4 series microcontroller. Our system is trained to recognize  the voice of the speaker on which the model is trained in our case we three. In addition, it is also capable of identifying the sounds of aa,ee,oo pronounced by any human being  in real time. Some of the topics we explored extensively in this project are Fast Fourier Transform, human speech analysis, MFCC and Machine Learning techniques for classification.

## Key Points for this Project 

### Usage of IDE's

Free versions of IDE's like Keil, IAR wont work with CMSIS DSP Library, since they have limited memory in the free version. Instead free IDE's like Atollic True Studio, GNU Eclipse based free IDE's should be used which dont have the memory constraint.

### Installation of CMSIS DSP Library

Download the CMSIS Library from the following [link](https://github.com/ARM-software/CMSIS_5) and follow the instruction as given in the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLHkYlF3suc&feature=youtu.be).
